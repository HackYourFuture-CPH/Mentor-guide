# Location: Aarhus



We host our onsite classes on **Sundays** between **12:00 - 16:00** at [Novicell](https://www.novicell.dk/) who were so kind to provide their location for our workshops. The address is **Søren Nymarks Vej 6 8270 Højbjerg.**&#x20;

There is plenty of parking available, as well as Bus 17 & 4A can take you there in about 25 minutes from Aarhus Central Station.
