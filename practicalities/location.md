# Location: Copenhagen

We host our onsite classes on **Sundays** between **12:00 - 16:00** at a co-working space in Vesterbro called [DISIE](https://disie.dk). The address is **Enghavevej 80c, 3. & 4. floor**. It's easiest to enter the building via the courtyard as described on the images below:

Please always give our staff a heads-up if you plan to swing by for a visit via cph@hackyourfuture.dk.\

Hope to see you soon!\
