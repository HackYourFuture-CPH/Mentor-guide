# üìç Location: Copenhagen

We host our onsite classes on **Sundays** between **12:00 - 16:00** at a co-working space on Holmen called [Talentgarden Rainmaking](https://talentgarden.org/en/coworking/denmark/copenhagen/). The address is **Danneskjold Sams√∏'s All√© 41**. We don't always put out signs outside or inside the building, so you can find us as described on the images below:\

Please always give our staff a heads-up if you plan to swing by for a visit via cph@hackyourfuture.dk. That way we can put some time aside for showing you around.\

Hope to see you soon!\
