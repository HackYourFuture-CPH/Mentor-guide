# Getting started

First please fill in your preferences for teaching (in the Preferences and Skills tab) [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bvagz2DZkV44Hb5a0eATC7tip34o_F496FKVzzmjQGU/edit?usp=sharing)

### Most crucial learning goals

We want our students to be able to work in a tech company in Denmark. Technical skills are important, but just as much is an understanding of what the job of a web-developer looks like. Collaboration, teamwork, an inquisitive mindset and **asking tons of questions** are crucial "soft" learnings that we want to encourage _over and over_. Relating what you teach in class to your daily tasks at work is also _always_ super useful.

### Slack

Our Slack workplace is the main communication tool we use. It has channels for every class, the main goal here is that we support students with questions/their homework during the week. You don't have to join all channels, but please join the one of the class that you are currently teaching or helping out with. If you are not invited to Slack yet: :arrow_right: :üë®‚Äçüíª:

### FAQ

- Q: **How much time does teaching require per week?**  
  A: It depends on the role. But aim at about 5-6 hours a week.

- Q: **Do I need to be a working professional to teach?**  
  A: No, you don't need to be a working professional, but it is a big plus. We want our students to learn from people who work with the frameworks we teach on a daily basis and know the challenges of the market.

- Q: **Will I be teaching all by myself?**  
  A: No, teaching always happens in pairs. This allows for less pressure on the individual, split responsibility and a broader perspective for our students.

- Q: **Do I have to teach exactly like it says in the repo?**  
  A: No, you can basically teach however you best see fit. We have learning goals we want to complete in each module and that the next module builds on. The students will work on the learning goals in the homework, therefore is very important that you teach those. You also don't need to reinvent the wheel about how to teach (but you can if you want to), all the material (code examples, exercises and documentation) is there in the lesson-plan if you prefer to follow existing instructions.

- Q: **When do the classes take place?**  
  A: Sundays 12:00 - 16:00

### So how is the curriculum structured?

Here is an overview of the curriculum

![Curriculum graphic + project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum/master/curriculum_2020.png)

As a mentor you book a specific module where you are responsible for the class in that time.

### Modules

- All modules have their own repository in our Github organization.
- We also have a nice and shiny overview of our [curriculum](https://github.com/HackYourFuture-CPH/curriculum). Here you can find information about when/how and what we teach.
- We divided everyone in our organization into teams, we have a teachers team, a team for every class etc. which all have different permissions.
- We have a private repository where fellow teachers share their [teaching-tips-and-tricks](https://github.com/HackYourFuture/teaching_tips_tricks), if you are new to teaching or are just curious on what they think works well in class, take a look.
- If you are teaching a certain module and would like to make changes on the contents of the repo, please create a branch with your name and your fellow teacher, like: `yourname_othername`. Our master branches are protected, if you would like to change something to the default module please make a PR.

### Workshops/master classes

Workshops / Masterclasses From time to time we organize workshops or alumni masterclasses in which we go into detail with a specific topic. We have organized masterclasses on .NET development, Web Bluetooth/Web USB, Web Content Management & CMS Systems, Docker and many more. If you have a suggestion for a topic, please let us know!
