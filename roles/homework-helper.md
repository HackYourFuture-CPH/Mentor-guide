# Homework helper

All our students hand in homework every week. In order for the students to improve all homeworks gets a review. This review can really help the students improve their skills.

## Responsibility

As a homework helper it is your responsibility to review homework. It is also your responsibility that all the homework gets reviewed. It is not you that has to do all the reviewing, but you have the responsibility do review all homeworks. Normally the homework helper gets help from the teacher assistant and sometimes also the main teacher.

## How students hand in homework

The students hand in homework using pull requests. The process goes like this:

1. The students create a pull request (PR) on their `hyf-homework` repo, fx https://github.com/panivita/hyf-homework
2. The PR now needs to be reviewed by a mentor
3. When the review has been received the students need to make changes based on the feedback
4. When changes has been made they can merge their PR and they are now fully done with their homework

There is a [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYlgh9hSWtw) that explains and shows how it works. There is an extra step which is that the students also need to review another class members homework.

## Homework assesment tool

To keep track of the homeworks and their status (mentioned above) we have made a tool that makes this process easier: https://hyf-homework-assesment.herokuapp.com/

Here you can select the class number you are responsible for (fx class 17), then choose the module (fx nodejs) and then the status (needs mentor feedback is the one you will be using). Then you have an overview of all the students that still need feedback for a specific module. Then you can just go to their PR and give feedback there. The website updates the student homework status by itself. In the bottom of the website there is a description for the different statuses

## Communication with HYF or lead teacher

I quite important that you communicate with us. That could be if you get busy or something comes up. If you communicate with us then we can find another helper or get the other teachers to help :)
