# ðŸ“ˆ Career Mentors

The mission of HYF is simple: _Get our students into quality tech jobs_. As a career mentor you will support the students on the "final mile" of their journey to become a tech professional and support them with knowledge about how to land their first job in tech.\
\
These roles are for volunteers with and without a technical background, but in-depth knowledge of the Danish IT Industry and its hiring processes is a key requirement.
